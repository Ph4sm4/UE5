there is an already built-in component that helps us deal with projectiles, it is called: UProjectileMovementComponent

We have to create it in the contructor as a normal component (using CreateDefaultSubobject)

it has its initialspeed, maxspeed that can be set

it makes the projectile fly, up until it hits something (it is exposed to gravity)

#include "GameFramework/ProjectileMovementComponent.h"
