camera - UCameraComponent
spring arm - USpringArmComponent

in order for it to work properly, we should always attach the camera to the spring arm, as it has a lot of important, built-in features

the way we do that is:

SpringArmComp = CreateDefaultSubobject<USpringArmComponent>(TEXT("Spring Arm"));
SpringArmComp->SetupAttachment(RootComponent);

CameraComp = CreateDefaultSubobject<UCameraComponent>(TEXT("Camera"));
CameraComp->SetupAttachment(SpringArmComp);

in the header file remember about forward declaration using the "class" keyword prefix

also it is good to enable displaying it to the unreal editor by passing the VisibleAnywhere for UPROPERTY()
