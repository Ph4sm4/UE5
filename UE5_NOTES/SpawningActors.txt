to spawn an actor into our scene we need to use a function

called UWorld::SpawnActor<>();

syntax:
GetWorld()->SpawnActor<C++ class>(UClass, location, rotation);

UClass is a special type that allows us to communicate and exchange informations between c++ and blueprints

to hold a variable which would represent our blueprint for instance, we need to use: 

TSubclassOf<class> _Name;

we should keep in my mind to expose it to blueprints UPROPERTY(), and from there set the variable's origin

this way we can set the variable to be a blueprint that has all the things set up (for example meshes)
