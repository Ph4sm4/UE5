Go to the element in which you want to add the component

select add c++ component, all classes and search for box collision


then in c++ you gotta copy the UCLASS from other component, the syntax is: 
UCLASS(ClassGroup = (Custom), meta = (BlueprintSpawnableComponent))

optionally add a constructor in which u can enable ticking by:
PrimaryComponentTick.bCanEverTick = true;

add these as well: 
protected:
	// Called when the game starts
	virtual void BeginPlay() override;

public:
	// Called every frame
	virtual void TickComponent(float DeltaTime, ELevelTick TickType, FActorComponentTickFunction* ThisTickFunction) override;
