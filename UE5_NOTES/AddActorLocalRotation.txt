just as we can move the actor relatively to its local location, we can rotate it around its local rotation

we've gotta have a function and we have to bind it to the proper axis mappings

the function body can look like this:

void ATank::Turn(float Value)
{
	FRotator DeltaRotation = FRotator::ZeroRotator;
	float DeltaTime = UGameplayStatics::GetWorldDeltaSeconds(this);

	DeltaRotation.Yaw = Value * DeltaTime * TurnRate;
	AddActorLocalRotation(DeltaRotation, true);
	
}

turn rate is basically telling us, by how much should we rotate every frame/every function call
