if we were to display a "Get Ready!" text, before our game starts, we need to create a viewport vidget

we do that by creating a new widget blueprint, prefix of the name is WBP_

we create that and add a canvas panel

from there we can drag stuff into the panel and edit them

after we create our widget blueprint, we need to hook up to our function StartGame(), which is a BlueprintImplementableEvent

and in the event graph we use Create Widget Function -> then connect the execution and the return pin to the Add Tp Viewport function

furthermore, we can hop into the event graph of the widget blueprint (top right corner), and define the logic, i.e. the countdown timer

so we can subtract from the countdown float = 3.f the delta time variable from the event tick function, next we have to set it back, and ceil up cause its a float (and we want integers)

then we can call switch on int and define what happens for each second, i.e. 0, 1, 2, 3

we can set the text on the widget by:
-first, we have to mark this element as a variable (top right corner, "Is Variable" checkbox)
-then we acccess it as a normal variable, and we can get the value of that element by dragging it into the event graph and call function SetText


in order to delete a widget, we can call RemoveFromParent


TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE WIDGET, WE HAVE TO GO TO THE BP_GAMEMODE EVENT GRAPH!!!

and there define whats gonna happen when the StartGame() (BlueprintImplementableEvent) function is gonna fire

in our case, we want to create a widget from our wbp class and after that we gotta add it to the viewport
