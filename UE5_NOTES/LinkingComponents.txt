If you have 2 actors living apart from each other in a level, and you want to link their components between them, you gotta do something alike dependency injection but on the level blueprint

1. get a reference to both actors that you want to link (by clicking on it in the level, going to blueprint, right clicking and it will appear on top)

2. get the component by class (your own classes) and then dependency injection as given
