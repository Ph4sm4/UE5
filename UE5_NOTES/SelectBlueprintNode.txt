there is a nice way to set some values depending on the input

for example, if we have a boolean that determines the text, i.e. to be "ONE" or "TWO", instead of using the BRANCH node, we can use the SELECT node

first we need to change the return type to be text, plug the boolean value

and set the texts, on true and false conditions

the thing that is gonna get returned is the text that we have set on those conditions
