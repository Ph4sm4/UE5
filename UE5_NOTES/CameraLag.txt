in order to smoothen out the camera movement we can set some lag on the spring arm component

camera lag is responsible for the camera movement so basically when we are moving across the world the movement is gonna be a bit lagged

camera rotation lag is responsible for the rotation, so basically when we are looking around the world, the rotation of the camera is gonna be bit lagged


there are variables:

camera lag speed
camera rotation lag speed

the smaller the values are, the stronger the lag will be
