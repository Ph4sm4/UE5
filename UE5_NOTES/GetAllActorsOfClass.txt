in order to get all instances of a class we have to use a function called 

GetAllActorsOfClass that exists in the UGameplayStatics

so: 

UGameplayStatics::GetAllActorsOfClass(world context ("this"), UClass (so we can call for example ATurret::StaticClass(), and it will return the required uclass), TArray<AActor*> &OutActors);

after that the number of actors of a particular class can be taken from OutActors.Num();

from there we can determine winning/losing conditions, for instance if we died then we can call GameOver(false) // the parameter is whether we lost or won

but to determine winning, we can have a variable that is set to the number of actors, and can be decremented every time the actor of that class is killed, in our case the turrets

if the value of that variable reaches 0, then we have won the game
