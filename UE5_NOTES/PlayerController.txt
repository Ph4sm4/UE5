first, it obviously derives from APlayerController class

in our case, we use it to enable/disable input, show the mouse cursor, set the mouse cursor type (in our case its a crosshair)

basically the player is enabled when being alive, when the player dies, it becomes disabled and so it should not response to any player input

it has one function SetPlayerEnabledState(bool bPlayerEnabled);

it's body:

void AToonTanksPlayerController::SetPlayerEnabledState(bool bPlayerEnabled)
{
	if (bPlayerEnabled) {
		GetPawn()->EnableInput(this); //it returns the pawn that it is controlling
	}
	else {
		GetPawn()->DisableInput(this);
	}

	bShowMouseCursor = bPlayerEnabled;
}

to use this player controller, we need to change it in our custom gamemode blueprint
