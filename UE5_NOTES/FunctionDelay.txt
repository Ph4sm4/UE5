FTimerHandle DelayTimer, DelayLocalTimer; -> these are our timers

GetWorld()->GetTimerManager().SetTimer(DelayLocalTimer, this, &UWeightTrigger::DelayedLocalMove, 1.0f, false);


GetWorld()->GetTimerManager().SetTimer(DelayTimer, this, &UWeightTrigger::DelayedMove, 5.0f, false);

1st argument is the timer which we wanna initiate
2nd argument is the class instance on which we wanna set the timer
3rd argument is the function that we wanna repeat/delay
4th argument is the delay after which our function is gonna fire off for the first time
5th argument is a boolean determining whether we wanna loop the timer or not
6th argument (not shown here) is the interval time in seconds (every x seconds the function fires off)

in order to stop the timer we gotta call:

GetWorld()->GetTimerManager().ClearTimer(FTimerHandle &x);

or there is also a function which clears all timers that are bound to function on a given object:

GetWorld()->GetTimerManager().ClearAllTimersForObject(Object); -> (Object can be "this")
