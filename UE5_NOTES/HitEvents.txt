UStaticMeshComponent has an ability to detect Hit Events (Multicast Delegates)

it has to be bound in the constructor

So Basically:

(UStaticMeshComponent*)
ProjectileMesh->OnComponentHit.AddDynamic(object ("this"), address of the function to bind);

it has an invocation list (list of functions to call)
broadcast when something happens (a hit) so that, all functions that are bound to this component multicast delegate, are called

it is required for the callback function to have specific parameters

these are, in order:

UPrimitiveComponent* HitComp (component of from our class that has been hit)
AActor* OtherActor (actor that has been hit)
UPrimitiveComponent* OtherComp (component of that actor, that has been hit)
FVector NormalImpulse (if simulating physics, this will represent the impulse vector that has been added to our object, for example it will bounce)
const FHitResult &HitResult


THIS FUNCTION HAS TO BE A UFUNCTION() !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
