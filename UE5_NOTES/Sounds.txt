in order to play a sound we first need to create a variable of type USoundBase*

we gotta expose it to blueprints and set the sound that we want

next, in order to play a sound, we have to use a function UGameplayStatics::PlaySoundAtLocation(world context, sound base* variable, location);

of course it has more overloads than that, but imma go deeper later on
