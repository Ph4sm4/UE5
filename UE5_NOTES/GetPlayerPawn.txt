to get the player's pawn, e.g. the pawn that the player is controlling, we have to use the function GetPlayerPawn available in UGameplayStatics class

we gotta do the following:

UGameplayStatics::GetPlayerPawn(the world context (can be "this"), index (for singleplayer games its always gonna be 0));
