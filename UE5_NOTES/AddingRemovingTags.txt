1. we have to have the actor first or a pointer to the actor
2. GetActor()->Tags.Add("name of the tag here");

3. GetActor()->Tags.Remove("name of the tag"); 
.Remove() will remove all occurences of the item which was specified


if you are looking for the grabbed component
first u gotta take the physics handle pointer and get grabbed component()

after that 

you gotta take the owner of that component, and from there you can access the .Tags property on which you can .Remove("tag"), or .Add("tag");
