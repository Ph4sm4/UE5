in order to bind an axis mapping you first of all have to go into project setting->input->axis mappings and add a mapping

bind it to whatever key you want

the scale property might be useful in terms of moving forward, for example:

when we are pressing 2 keys at a time (w, s) then we do not wanna move (the mapping would have 2 keys -> w, s with a scale 1.0 and -1.0) now after pressing those 2 keys the value is gonna get combined into one:

1.0 + (-1.0) = 0.0

so basically the scale is determining the strength of the action/movement

after creating a mapping we can bind that mapping to a function (the class having the function must be a type that has the ability to receive input, for instance Pawn)

it has a function SetupPlayerInputComponent(UInputComponent* PlayerInputComponent)

the body of it:
void ATank::SetupPlayerInputComponent(UInputComponent* PlayerInputComponent)
{
	Super::SetupPlayerInputComponent(PlayerInputComponent);
}

in it we can bind whatever we want

we do it by:

PlayerInputComponent->BindAxis(TEXT("NAME OF THE MAPPING"), the object to bind it to (can be "this"), the function with the address of)

for instance:


PlayerInputComponent->BindAxis(TEXT("MoveForward"), this, &ATank::Move);

keep in mind that the Move function has to receive a float parameter (Scale/Value) and its of type void
