1. create a grabber tracer in project settings and turn it to be ignored by default
2. restart the engine
REMEMBER TO THEN ENABLE THE TRACER ON FOR THE ACTOR WHICH WE WANNA INTERACT WITH!!!!!
3. create a scene component (grabber)

4. to draw a line u gotta:
	- get the starting position which is gonna be the components position (GetComponentLocation())
	- get the end position which is the start position + the distance of an arm * forward vector
	- and lastly use DrawDebugLine(GetWorld(), StartPosition, EndPosition, FColor::Emerald)

5. now whether to know if we have hit anything we gotta use something called 
GetWorld()->SweepSingleByChannel(OutResult, StartPosition, EndPosition, FQuat::Identity, Channel of the trace which can be found in config folder under DefaultEngine.ini file, Sphere)

SweepSingleByChannel returns a bool, it says whether we've hit anything

To create a Sphere --> FCollisionShape Sphere = FCollisionShape::MakeSphere(GrabRadius)
Grab Radius is basically sphere's diameter
OutResult stores actors that we have hit (if any)
To get the actor's name OutResult.GetActor()->GetActorNameOrLabel();

In order to work properly camera component should have the grabber scene component on it
