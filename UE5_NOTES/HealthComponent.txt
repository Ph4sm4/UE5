this component does not to be visible, nor possessed. we dont care about its location/rotation etc. thats why it should be a UActorComponent 

after creation we have to bind (in begin play) our function DamageTaken to a delegate
we want to bind it to the owner, as it will be the one taking damage:

GetOwner()->OnTakeAnyDamage.AddDynamic("object", function address);

BUT, the function itself needs to have specific parameters and be a UFUNCTION()!!!!!

these are, in order:

AActor* DamagedActor
float Damage
const UDamageType* DamageType (in unreal we can have custom damage types, like fire, heat, cold etc...)
AController* Instigator (this is the controller responsible for damage, for example if the pawn that is being possessed caused the damage, then the instigator would be the controller of that pawn)
AActor* DamageCauser
