to create a timer we need a FTimerHandle, this is gonna be responsible for tracking THIS PARTICULAR timer, thanks to that, we can have mulitple timers at the same time

to set the timer we need to call a function GetWorldTimerManager().SetTimer

first argument is the timer handle
second is the class we want to bind the timer to
third is the function that we wanna call
forth is the interval duration
fifth is whether we wanna loop the timer (if false, its gonna execute only once)
