First to detect overlapping actors we have to set the same tag on both - the actor that we are trying to detect and the trigger component. uproperty recommended

the tag MUST be identical

then we can get the array of currently overlapping actors by:

TArray<AActor*> Actors;
GetOverlappingActors(Actors);

for (auto Actor : Actors) {
	if (Actor->ActorHasTag(UnlockTag)) {
		return Actor;
	}
}

return nullptr;

GetOverlappingActors takes an array of actor pointers, and populetes it with those pointers

so we can later go through that array and check if there was a match. e.g. if the any of the overlapping actors has the same tag
