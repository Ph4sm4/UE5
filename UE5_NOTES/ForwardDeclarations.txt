to avoid copying unnecessary header files, we should only include them in places where we need them, usually in the .cpp files, but for instance for inheritance we need to include them in .h

otherwise, if we want to have a capsule component, then we can just store a pointer to it with a forward declaration of certain type:

class UCapsuleComponent* CapsuleComp;

and later in the .cpp we gonna have to include the proper header file 

BUT BUT BUT if we have for example 2 variables of the same forward declared type

we only need to forward declare it for the first time when we use it

for example 

class XYZ var1;

XYZ var2; //no need of forward declaration

that is why, it is good practice to forward declare types after includes, so that we can use that type anywhere in the file
