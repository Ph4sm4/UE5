using function AddActorLocalOffset we can move the actor in its own local direction 

it takes one obligatory parameter which is a FVector DeltaLocation (the vector offset by which we wanna move)

we usually would use it in the tick function, or bind it into an input mapping

good practice is to setup DeltaLocation vector's X,Y,Z so that they are framerate independent:

float DeltaTime = UGameplayStatics::GetWorldDeltaSeconds(this);
DeltaLocation.X = Value * DeltaTime * Speed;


GetWorldDeltaSeconds(the world that we are in)
