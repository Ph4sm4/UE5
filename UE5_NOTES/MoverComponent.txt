1. Add the Actor Component onto the element
2. UPROPERTIES:
	- Position Offset (how far to move from the current position)
	- Move Speed (in seconds)
	- Should move
3. gotta get the starting pos by GetOwner()->GetActorLocation()

4. then in the tick component:
	- get the current location 
	- set the target location (start + offset)
	- speed (by how much should we move during this tick) distance between current and target 		location / movespeed
	- new location is gonna be obv a FVector = FMath::VInterpConstantTo(currLocation, Targetlocation, DeltaTime, speed);
	- FMath::VInterpConstantTo is a shorthand for vector interpolation from start position to the target position with a constant step (speed)

5. set the actor location by GetOwner()->SetActorLocation(newLocation);
