first of all, in order to spawn particles on a given actor, we need a variable of type

UParticleSystem* Particles;
we should expose it to blueprints, so that we can edit its value in the editor, and set to a certain particle effect

then, we can spawn that effect with a use of:

UGameplayStatics::SpawnEmitterAtLocation(this, Particles,
		GetActorLocation(), GetActorRotation());

first argument is world context
second argument is the projectile system variable
third argument is the location on which the effect should be spawned
forth argument is the rotation with which the particle should be spawned
