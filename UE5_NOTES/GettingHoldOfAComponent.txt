1. to get a hold of another component from within our component we have to use:

	GetOwner()->FindComponentByClass<ClassName>();
2. it returns a pointer so if we were to store it in a variable we would have to:
	ClassName* var_name = ...
for instance for class UPhysicsHandleComponent it would look like this:
	
UPhysicsHandleComponent* physicsHandle = GetOwner()->FindComponentByClass<UPhysicsHandleComponent>();
